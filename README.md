# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms Repository

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** repository!  
This repository is a collection of all the problems, notes, and implementations I created while learning DSA. It's designed to help me (and others) review, revise, and practice key concepts of DSA using clear examples and well-documented code.

## 🚀 What's Inside

- 🔢 **Arrays & Strings**
- 🌲 **Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs.)**
- 🌉 **Graphs (BFS, DFS.)**
- 🎯 **Stacks & Queues**
- 🧠 **Linked Lists**
- 🧩 **Hashing & HashMaps**
- 🧬 **Dynamic Programming (DP)**
  
---

## 🧠 Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:

- To **consolidate** DSA learning from various sources.
- To **practice solving** problems using clean, readable code.
- To **document patterns** and **explanations** for revision.
- To **prepare** for technical interviews and competitive programming.
